This is an attempt to summaraize my planner plans and previous usage/systems

## 2024
This is more than I planned on or wanted to spend. I put off all the new fancy Tomoe River planners the planner community is putting out there, although I've been tempted.

* [ ] Kokuyo x Bushimen PAL ("Plan and Log") planner
  * To track (log only) metrics and details of my overall well-being in hopes to influence it for the better. Things that contribute (e.g. sleep, exercise, gratitude, meditation) and things that detract (e.g. too much screen time, too much sugar/ caffeine).
  * To review wins and losses for learnings (e.g. how I might not get derailed by a rough days). Not fully a journal, but something I can look for trends in, refine my systems of well-being, and pull things to remember into my Deck from.
