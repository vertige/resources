# Techo Kigai
> _"Techo"_ means "planner" and _"Kigai"_ means "system" in Japanese

This is an attempt to summaraize my planner plans and previous usage/systems

## 2024
This is more than I planned on or wanted to spend. I put off all the new fancy Tomoe River planners the planner community is putting out there, although I've been tempted.
* Google Calendar
  * Single source of truth for appointments. Multiple shared calendars for overview of availability.
* GitHub
 * Personal management and resource sharing
 * Projects
* [x] Kokuyo x Bushimen PAL ("Plan and Log") planner
  * To track (log only) metrics and details of my overall well-being in hopes to influence it for the better. Things that contribute (e.g. sleep, exercise, gratitude, meditation) and things that detract (e.g. too much screen time, too much sugar/ caffeine).
  * To review wins and losses for learnings (e.g. how I might not get derailed by a rough days). Not fully a journal, but something I can look for trends in, refine my systems of well-being, and pull things to remember into my Deck from.
* [x] Take A Note Record Series Undated Monthly booklet
  * To track events and appointments for DC, keeping notes in the memo pages. Replaces Hobonichi Weeks from last year.
  * Compact, can be kept with other daily notebooks as needed.
* [x] Hobonichi Weeks planner
  * Meal planning notebook
* [x] ~~Take A Note Record Series Weekly Undated~~ Partially used Wonderland 222 B6 notebook with custom layout
  * 12 Week Year Planning and Journal. Each day will correspond to a week, roughly.
* [x] Hobonichi Weeks planner
  * Daily Carry. GTD list book.
* [x] Take A Note Record Series Master Journal
  * Daily Carry. Forward: Journal, Backward: Project Notes & Ideas
* [x] Kokuyo Field Notes & Index Cards

* [x] ~~Midori 5 Year Journal~~ Kept Journal with extra notes tucked in.
  * Memory keeping for child.
* Other
  * Binder clips
  * Trying out Pilot Frixion pens again since they have a darker reformulated black ink and life is too crazy for fountain pen maintenance and clean up right now.
  * Maple App
   * Trying to see if this is a better option than Cozi for household management
  * Grocery App
   * Similar idea to my meal planning idea, testing.
  * Notion
   * Some personal and collaborative family projects
   * Some public facing resources
  * DAKBoard
   * Family dashboard 

## 2023
* Google Calendar
  * Single source of truth for appointments. Multiple shared calendars for overview of availability.
* Hobonichi Weeks
  * Tracked child's events and appointments, kept notes.
  * Attempted to use with some memory keeping but didn't blend well, or have enough space with appointment notes, etc.
  * __Learning__: Keep memories separate from things like doctor's appointment notes ðŸ™ƒ
 
## 2022
* Google Calendar
  * Single source of truth for appointments. Added multiple shared calendars for overview of availability since family grew.
* Papermood Weeks (late 2022)
  * Personal agenda turned appointment notebook and memory keeper
 
## Deck
* Started in 2023
* Index cards I keep perpetual and reference information on, such as quotes, rolodex, thoughts, notes, gratitude lists, prompts, etc. Not exactly Zettelkasten. Nice to flip through vs digital. Great for rediscovery.
