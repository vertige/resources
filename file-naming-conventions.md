# Digital File Management

## Objective

## File Naming Conventions

### Objective
To maintain a consistent file naming policy and process for easy retrieval of digital files and media.

### Basics
1. File names will contain a series of elements.
2. All words will be lower case
3. Elements are delimited by `_`, which are interpreted as separate words by most interpreters.
4. Words within an element are separated by a `-`

### Element Order
1. Elements should be ordered from general to specific.

### Dates
1. Dates are ordered from general to specific. Example: `20230101`.

### Versioning
1. If needed, use a `_v` followed by a double digit numeral. For example, the first version of a text file file would be `file-name_v01.txt`
2. Increment versions as needed
3. If you are doing major and minor versions, the major version number would be followed by a `-` and a double digit. For example, the first minor update of the first version of a file would be `file-name_v01-01.txt`
