# Digital File Management

## Objective

## File Naming Conventions

### Objective
To maintain a consistent file naming policy and process for easy retrieval of digital files and media.

### Basics
1. File names will contain a series of elements.
2. Lower case letters and numerals only, no special characters, no white space. So, `a-z` and `0-9`.
3. Elements are delimited by `_`, which are interpreted as separate words by most interpreters.
4. Words within an element are separated by a `-`
5. Elements should be concise, descriptive and abbreviated where the abbreviation is clearly understandable. Example: `washington-department-of-licensing-application-receipt` could easily be `wa-dol-application-receipt`.

### Element Order
1. Elements should be ordered from general to specific.

### Dates
1. Dates are ordered from general to specific. Example: `20230101`.

### Versioning
1. If needed, use a `_v` followed by a double digit numeral. For example, the first version of a text file file would be `file-name_v01.txt`
2. Increment versions as needed
3. If you are doing major and minor versions, the major version number would be followed by a `-` and a double digit. For example, the first minor update of the first version of a file would be `file-name_v01-01.txt`

### Folder Structure
1. [...]
2. Folder Structure should be replicated across all individual platforms. This ensures naming conventions are consistent and expedites retrieval.
3. Use a `Share` folder for all files being shared in cloud or network storage.

### Sharing Files
1. When sharing a file, prefix the file with the folder name
2. Copy the file to the Share Folder
